# lane-detection-segmentation-JYQ-
The main goal of this project is to perform lane detection through semantic segmentation using deep learning models. It implements six different models, including Segformer+UNet+CNN(hybrid model), all built with the PyTorch framework. This project is the first of three practical projects.
