# Semantic Segmentation for Lane Lines (segformer+unet+cnn Hybrid Model)

This project focuses on lane line semantic segmentation using the s+u+c hybrid model.

## Project Introduction

The goal of this project is to perform lane line detection using semantic segmentation techniques. The project leverages the segformer+unet+cnn hybrid model to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the detection.
